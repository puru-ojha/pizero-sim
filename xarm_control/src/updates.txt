- **REFACTOR**: Simplified the robot initialization sequence. The xArm now moves directly to its hardcoded start position (`XARM_POLICY_START_JOINT_POS`) instead of moving to home first and then interpolating to the start. This removes unnecessary complexity and the risk of generating invalid intermediate joint states.
- **IMPROVEMENT**: Enhanced the initial Franka IK calculation by seeding it with a `FRANKA_CANONICAL_READY_POSE`. Previously, a zero-vector was used, which could result in unpredictable or visually awkward joint configurations. Using a canonical pose as a seed guides the solver to a more natural and stable solution, ensuring better visual consistency between the xArm and its Franka counterpart from the very start.

### 2025-07-17 (Session 6)
- **REFACTOR**: Enhanced robot initialization by moving the xArm to its home position, then gradually to the policy start position. During this movement, the Franka equivalent joint states are continuously tracked and updated using FK on xArm and IK on Franka, ensuring a robust and accurate initial Franka joint configuration for policy execution.
- **UPDATE**: Created new URDF files (`panda_nomesh.urdf`, `xarm7_nomesh.urdf`) for Franka and xArm respectively, specifically designed to be compatible with the `ikpy` library. This addresses issues with previous URDFs that were not directly usable with `ikpy` due to their structure or content.

### 2025-07-17 (Session 5)
- **REFACTOR**: Replaced the entire custom kinematics engine (FK and IK) with the `ikpy` library. This provides a faster, more accurate, and more robust solution by using optimized, compiled code for kinematic calculations. The node now loads the robot models from their URDF files.

### 2025-07-17 (Session 4)
- **FIX**: Corrected a critical bug where the gripper's state was never updated. The system now updates its internal gripper state after sending a command, ensuring the policy receives accurate feedback and can perform manipulation tasks correctly.

### 2025-07-17 (Session 3)
- **REFACTOR**: Reworked the robot's initialization logic for a more stable start. The system now begins with a canonical 'default' Franka joint configuration. The xArm is then commanded to move to match the Franka's end-effector pose, ensuring the virtual and real robots are perfectly synchronized from the first cycle.

### 2025-07-17 (Session 2)
- **UPDATE**: Improved IK failure handling. Instead of skipping the control cycle (which freezes the robot), the system now logs a warning and proceeds using the last known-good Franka joint state. This allows the robot to continue operating through transient IK failures.

### 2025-07-17
- **FIX**: Made trajectory execution blocking in `send_trajectory` by uncommenting `wait_for_result()` and adding a timeout to prevent hangs. This ensures one command finishes before the next starts.
- **FIX**: Modified the main control loop to update the robot's state using actual measured joint positions from the `/xarm/joint_states` topic, correcting potential state drift.
- **FIX**: Added checks to handle Inverse Kinematics (IK) failures gracefully. The node will now log a warning and reuse the last known state instead of potentially crashing the policy server with invalid data.
