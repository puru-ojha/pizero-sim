What We Have (Current State):

Franka Emika Panda Simulation Package (franka_ros):

franka_gazebo: A package within franka_ros specifically for simulating the Panda robot in Gazebo.
panda.launch: The main launch file for starting the Panda simulation. It provides many options:
Starting Gazebo (with or without GUI, paused or running).
Choosing a world file.
Spawning the robot with specific initial positions, poses, and configurations.
Enabling/disabling the gripper.
Selecting different example controllers.
robot.launch: this file is included in the panda.launch file. It has the task of actually spawning the robot.
panda_table_world.world: The newly created Gazebo world file that defines:
A ground plane.
A sun (for lighting).
A table.
Two boxes on the table.
Physics properties (gravity, step size, etc.).
panda.urdf.xacro: A macro-based URDF file that:
Includes franka_robot.xacro (likely defining the core robot structure).
Allows customization (arm ID, gripper, TCP offset, gazebo, etc.).
References joint_limits.yaml (for joint limits).
CMakeLists.txt: Defines how the franka_gazebo package should be built. It:
Finds necessary ROS and external packages (Gazebo, ROS, KDL, Franka, etc.).
Creates libraries (franka_hw_sim, franka_gripper_sim).
Installs various files (plugins, launch, config).
Handles code formatting and linting.
franka_description: there are the urdf and other files that define the robot.
xArm Simulation Package (xarm_ros):

xarm_gazebo: A package for simulating the xArm robot in Gazebo.
xarm_example1_table_copy.world: The Gazebo world file used for the xArm, which serves as a template for our new panda_table_world.world.
xarm_control:

This package contains the code of the control node.
It contains a launch file and a config file.
External Control Code:

camera_joint_control_node.py: A ROS node (in xarm_control) that:
Communicates with Gazebo to get camera images and joint states.
Communicates with an external Python server (server.py).
Sends commands to the robot.
server.py: An external Python server that:
Receives observations from the robot.
Generates movement instructions.
Sends the instructions back to the robot.
The openpi_client is used to manage the communication between the camera_joint_control_node and the server.
What We've Done (Recent Progress):

Created panda_table_world.world:
We successfully created a new world file based on xarm_example1_table_copy.world.
It includes the ground plane, sun, table, two boxes, and physics properties.
We removed the cylinder object, to match the original xarm_world.
We kept the same position and orientation of the table and boxes.
Modified panda.launch:
We changed the panda.launch file to use the new panda_table_world.world file by default.
We are now ready to spawn the panda robot in this new world.
What We're Doing (Current Focus):

Adapting the Control System:
Our current focus is to adapt the existing external control system (using camera_joint_control_node.py and server.py) to work with the Panda robot.
This involves:
Changing ROS topic names for joint states and possibly cameras.
Updating joint names in camera_joint_control_node.py.
Modifying the trajectory message to work with the panda robot.
Adjusting the default position of the robot.
Creating a config file for the controllers.
Creating a new launch file for the control node.
What We Plan to Do (Next Steps):

Create the new control config file: we need a file with the names of the controllers and joints.
Modify camera_joint_control_node.py:
Update joint state topic subscription (to /panda/joint_states).
Update joint names (to panda_joint1, panda_joint2, etc.).
Update the default position.
Update the convert_action_to_trajectory function.
Create the new control launch file: we will create a new launch file for the control node.
Test the Panda in Gazebo:
Launch the simulation using roslaunch franka_gazebo panda.launch.
Verify that the Panda, table, and boxes are loaded in the panda_table_world.world environment.
Test the Control System:
Run server.py.
Launch the new camera_joint_control_node.py with the new launch file.
Observe the robot's behavior.
Troubleshoot and iterate as needed.
Overall Strategy:

Reuse: We're reusing the existing control architecture as much as possible.
Adapt: We're carefully adapting the code to fit the Panda robot's specifics.
Incremental: We're making changes in small, manageable steps.
Test-Driven: We're emphasizing testing after each change.
Key Points:

We've made excellent progress by creating the new world file and adapting the main launch file.
We're now entering the critical phase of modifying the control code and testing everything together.
The panda.urdf.xacro file defines the robot, and the CMakeLists.txt describes the build process, but we won't directly edit these files for our next tasks.


What We've Done:

Created panda_table_world.world: A Gazebo world file was created, setting up a table scene for the robot.
Modified panda.launch: The main launch file was updated to use the new world file.
Addressed Robot Spawning Issues: Redundant attempts to spawn the robot were removed from panda.launch, resolving the "model name panda already exists" error.
Corrected URDF Inertial Properties: Missing inertial properties (mass and inertia tensor) in the panda.urdf file were identified and corrected. This resolved the warnings related to missing inertial data in the Gazebo output.
Addressed Namespace Warning: A warning about a mismatch between the robot name in the launch file and the URDF was addressed by explicitly defining the <robotNamespace> in panda.urdf.xacro.

The camera information is there in the franka_robot.xarco file as well as utils.xarco file
